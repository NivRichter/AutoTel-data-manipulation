# TelAuto-data-manipulation
### Kaggle based project desginated to self study of pyhton capabilities of data science

The idea was to check the correlation between car rental usage and rainy days.
The conclustion as can be seen in the Notebook, is that on rainy days the cars rental percantge is indeed higher as expected.
I should mention that I couldn't find data about volume of rain per hour, only rain per day. Therefore, the above conlcusion is only as accurate as the data can be.
The project is based on data scapred from here https://www.kaggle.com/gidutz/autotel-shared-car-locations.
